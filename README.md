# site

Learned html, css, php and integrated c++ knowledge to serve an unsecured website that allowed user logins and
communicated with an arduino to be able to control relay switches and a solenoid valve of an outdoor greenhouse garden.

Was fully functional but capable of starting an electrical fire. 

Raspbian/debian/apache updates made it difficult to keep server up.
