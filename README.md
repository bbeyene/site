# site

Learned basic html, css and php and integrated c++ knowledge to serve an unsecured website that allowed user logins and
communicated with an arduino to be able to control relay switches and solenoid valve of a greenhouse 'system'.

Was fully functional but capable of starting an electrical fire. 

Raspbian/debian/apache updates made it annoying to keep server up.
